# QuickMeasure
Quick Measure is a tool designed to measure features quickly without needing to add dimensions to the graphicâ€™s window.
Selecting a vertex from the graphic window will result in the x, y, z position of the vertex being shown in the dialog. 
Selecting a line will also show its length, a  Sphere shows the radius, a cylinder the radius plus the length. 
Selecting two features will show the distance between them plus, when applicable, the distance in x, y and z axis. Lines and cylinders show if they are parallel or not.   
Selecting three or more surfaces together adds the areas of the surfaces together.
