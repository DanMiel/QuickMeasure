# QuickMeasure
Quick Measure is a tool designed to measure features quickly without needing to add dimensions to the graphic’s window.
To use add the QuickMeasure folder to the FreeCAD/mod folder. Select Quick Measure from the WorkBench dropdown.
Selecting a vertex from the graphic window will result in the x, y, z position of the vertex being shown in the dialog. 
Selecting a line will also show its length, a  Sphere shows the radius, a cylinder the radius plus the length. 
Selecting two features will show the distance between them plus, when applicable, the distance in x, y and z axis. Lines and cylinders show if they are parallel or not.   
Selecting three or more surfaces together adds the areas of the surfaces together.
To add this program download the zip file using the “Code” button. Unzip the file and drop the Quick Measure folder into the FreeCAD/Mod folder. Restart and select QuickMeasure from the Workbench dropdown.
